# My first website project
This is my first attempt to "create" a website for assignment. The goal was to re-create the website using the design file as accurate as possible using html, css, javascript and php. The end result is pretty accurate to the design file, there's a little bit of functionality (for example: you can send information to the database to using forms on the webpage), the design is responsive to the different size screens.
You can check out code above or download the .rar with all the files.
